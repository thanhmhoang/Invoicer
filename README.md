 ## Description
  
  AS a Business Owner
  I WANT to be able to keep track of all of my business's invoices
  SO THAT I know they are organized and being paid on time. 
 
 ## Usage

 A web application for small companies or individuals to track owed invoices and the companies they work for. The application is simple and streamlined while still allowing necessary functionality for keeping on top of business finances and helping to maintain customer/wholesaler relationships. 

  ## Learn

  When looking at full stack web development, there are so many more things that all piece together in such a way that communication is crucial between all parties. We communicated pretty constantly the entire time we were working and really relied on each other for not only work support but also support with frustrations and painpoints. It was reassuring to have other peopole to rely on during an intense project like this. 

  ## Issues

  The biggest issue we ran into was our CSS styling was not working and instead was disrupting the rest of our code. We troubleshot the issue multiple times and even utilized help from resources and people around us. In the end, we got some styling on the page but it was not as well put together as the original work. Please see photos below showing the before (including responsive webpage) and after.
